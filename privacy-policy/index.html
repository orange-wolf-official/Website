<p>Last updated: December 31, 2023</p>
<h2 id="intro">INTRO</h2>
<p>Orange Wolf Dijital Oyun Teknolojileri Anonim Şirketi (&ldquo;Orange Wolf&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;) is a technology company that designs and develops mobile games. With this Privacy Policy, we aim to explain how and why we gather, store, share, and use your personal data in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries where we do business.
When this Policy refers to &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; in this Policy, we mean any information that can be used to identify, relate to, characterize, or reasonably be linked, either directly or indirectly, with a specific natural person or household, as well as any other information that falls under the definition of &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; or &ldquo;personally identifiable information.&rdquo;
This privacy policy covers all of the following: websites, mobile applications, blogs, forums, offline services, our advertising and promotional activities across all platforms, and any other services we might occasionally offer to you (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Employees, job candidates, and other personnel of Orange Wolf are not covered by this privacy policy.
Orange Wolf oversees the management of the information we possess pertaining to you in relation to your utilization of the Services. In essence, we decide and bear the responsibility for the utilization of your personal data. According to this Privacy Policy, your personal data will be handled to facilitate the provision of the Services following your download of our mobile applications, engagement with our games, or interaction with our Services. Should you have any reservations about furnishing us with data or its utilization as outlined in this Privacy Policy, you can reach out to us and exercise the rights detailed in the Security section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-collect-your-personal-data">HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>We might gather personal information either directly from you or through third-party entities with whom you have granted consent or who possess legal authorization to share such data with us (including advertising platforms, partners, and data aggregators). This information may encompass details about your attributes, interests, other games and services you engage with, as well as demographic and general location information. The utilization of your personal data will align with the provisions outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="personal-data-collected-directly-from-you">Personal Data Collected Directly from You</h3>

</ol>
<h3 id="information-we-collect-automatically">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p>Depending on your interaction with specific Services we offer, we may collect and process various types of information, including:
Analytics Data: This involves details about your usage and interactions with our games, advertising, and other Services. Examples include information on when and how you use our Services, the device you use for access, and technical diagnostics such as battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, or crash logs pertaining to the performance of our Services on your device.
Device Data: This includes your unique device ID (persistent/non-persistent), Identifier For Advertisers (IDFA), Identifier for Vendor (IDFV), and game center ID.
Location Data: This encompasses your location based on your Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;).
Commercial Information: Such as details about products and services purchased, obtained, or considered, as well as other histories or tendencies related to purchasing or consumption.
We and our third-party providers may utilize technologies like cookies (small data files stored on an individual&rsquo;s computer), web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and logging technologies (collectively referred to as &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;) to deliver our website services. For more detailed information, please refer to the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="personal-data-collected-from-third-parties">Personal Data Collected from Third Parties</h3>
<p>As previously stated, the majority of the data we get about you is provided by you when you use our services or play our games. On the other hand, we also obtain information from third parties that you authorize to access your personal data (for example, by installing our mobile applications through the App Store or Google Store and connecting your Facebook account to mobile applications).</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Media: We may receive information about individuals that they allow the social network to share with third parties when you interact with our Services through different social media networks. Examples of these interactions include when someone &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; us on Facebook, follows us, or shares our content on Google, Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks. Depending on a user&rsquo;s privacy choices on the social network, we may obtain information about them that includes their name, profile image, and friend list. Before sharing information or connecting to other services, users should always check and, if needed, modify their privacy settings on third-party websites, social media networks, and services. We use this information for the purpose of running, maintaining, and offering you the features and functionalities of the Services. We also use it for direct communication, such as sending you emails about goods and services that could be of interest to you.</li>
<li>Service Providers: Orange Wolf does not have access to your credit card or bank account information when you install or purchase things related to our mobile apps (such as those available through the App Store or Google Play). However, the previously mentioned third-party payment processors may share non-financial information about your purchases with us, such as the items purchased to fulfill your order. Personal data obtained from third-party firms will be subject to the privacy settings of the relevant third-party applications.</li>
<li>Authentication Services: Certain aspects of our Services offer you the option to log in using a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook. These services serve to authenticate your identity and provide you with the opportunity to share specific personal data with us. This may include details like your name, email address, user ID associated with the third-party, profile picture, and the names and avatars of your Facebook friends who are already engaged with our games. The extent of data we receive is contingent upon the policies of the third party and your privacy settings on that particular third-party site. Where applicable, you&rsquo;ll also have the ability to view which of your friends are participating in the same game, monitor their progress, and allow them to see your advancements. Additionally, various functionalities within our games and other Services, such as inviting friends to play, may be accessible. It&rsquo;s important to note that, during the initial association of your Facebook account with your Orange Wolf profile, you have the choice to withhold access to your email address through the Facebook dialog box. Logging in with Facebook does not grant us permission to post anything to your page without your explicit consent, and we do not receive information about your Facebook friends who do not engage with our games. If you prefer not to have your Facebook friends view your progress within our games, you can prevent this by disconnecting from Facebook within our games and adjusting your app permissions from within your Facebook settings. Opting not to create an Orange Wolf profile by linking your Facebook account means that the personal data we collect during your gameplay will be associated with a random identifier rather than direct identifying information. However, we will still collect device-level identifiers and other information associated with those identifiers, as previously described. We recommend that you read Facebook&rsquo;s Privacy Policy and review your privacy settings from time to time to ensure that you understand fully how your Facebook data is shared.</li>
<li>Other Sources: We may also collect personal data about individuals that we do not otherwise have from, for example, publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide you with the features and functionality of our Services.</li>
<li>Other Sources: Additionally, we may acquire personal data about individuals from sources other than direct interactions, such as publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions like mergers and acquisitions.

<h2 id="third-party-data-collection-and-online-advertising">THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING</h2>
<p>We engage in interest-based advertising and collaborate with third-party advertising companies to deliver targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We authorize third-party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to gather information about your usage of our online services over time. This data is used to display ads on our Services, other websites or services you may use, and across various devices you utilize.
Our advertising partners may enhance ad targeting by combining your personal data with information they have collected about you from other sources. They gather this data when you use their services or visit third-party websites. Our partners use this information to make assumptions about your preferences and serve you advertisements tailored to your interests, including ads for Orange Wolf&rsquo; Services when you use other websites and services.
To facilitate these processes, we utilize ad identifiers and similar technologies, allowing our third-party advertising partners and us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize you and your device.</li>
<li>Provide interest-based advertising.</li>
<li>Enable interactions between our Services and third-party social networks or platforms, if you have granted permission for such interaction.</li>
<li>Enable the provision of more customized services, such as delivering our Services in the correct language.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information used for interest-based advertising is typically collected through tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar tools. These technologies identify the device you are using and collect various details, such as click stream information, browser type, visit time and date, AdID, precise location data, and more. We may share a common account identifier, like a hashed email address or user ID, with our third-party advertising partners to recognize you across different devices.
This information is utilized by our third-party partners and us to enhance the relevance of online advertisements, providing advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. Additionally, we may use services from third parties, like social media platforms, to deliver targeted ads. This may involve providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.
Our website currently employs strictly necessary, functional, analytical/performance, and advertising/targeting cookies. Please refer to the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy for more detailed information.</p>
<h2 id="cookies">COOKIES</h2>

<h2 id="international-transfer">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h2>
<p>All personal data collected or stored by Orange Wolf may be stored in various locations worldwide, including, but not limited to, the Republic of Turkey, the United States, and the European Union. When we transfer your personal data internationally, we will take reasonable steps to ensure its secure, lawful, and consistent treatment, as described here. It&rsquo;s important to note that privacy laws differ across jurisdictions, and the laws applicable to where your personal data is transferred, stored, used, or processed may not offer the same level of protection as the laws in your resident country.
For international transfers of personal data outside of Europe, we rely on appropriate or suitable safeguards recognized under applicable law. This includes adequacy decisions and adherence to standard contractual clauses.
If you are using our Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please be aware that providing your personal data to us implies your consent for processing it in the locations mentioned above.
By choosing to visit the Services or providing information to us, you agree that any privacy-related dispute or disputes concerning the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy will be subject to the laws of the Republic of Turkey. Adjudication of disputes related to our Services will be under the terms specified in the Orange Wolf Terms of Service.</p>

<p>The personal data you share with Orange Wolf is stored on servers located in secure facilities. These servers are safeguarded by protocols and procedures, including firewalls and data encryption, designed to maintain industry-standard security for such data. It&rsquo;s crucial to note that, despite these measures, no server, computer system, communication network, or data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While Orange Wolf is committed to safeguarding your personal data, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any personal data you transmit to us or through the Services.
By utilizing the Services or providing personal data to us, you acknowledge and agree that we may communicate with you electronically concerning security, privacy, and administrative matters related to your use of the Services.
